# Executive Function Bot
A work in progress Telegram bot to help people with Executive Function Disorder (ADD and ADHD) with certain tasks that are more difficult than they need to be.

For instance:
- Remembering to Eat regularly
- Tracking their feelings over time
- Prioritizing and remembering tasks

This is very much a work in progress and I would be thrilled to have others working with me on this. Feel free to fork this bot for your own needs and to submit Pull Requests to add functions.
